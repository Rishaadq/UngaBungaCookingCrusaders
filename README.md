Okay, so here is how to get everything with npm set up first.
Basically npm is a package manager for the Javascript programming language, and it also has the http-server package, which I use to host the site locally. 
We can actually include server-side descriptions in our description for Assignment 1 now! 
I decided to host our site on a node js server. And you need to install npm on your CLI first.
Go to this link: https://radixweb.com/blog/installing-npm-and-nodejs-on-windows-and-mac
Once you have npm set up on your CLI, go to the UngaBungaCookingCrusaders folder and run npm install
After that, run npm start, and you should be good to go to run the site locally. The URL you need to go to will be logged in the console when you start the server.
