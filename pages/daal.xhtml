          EASILY lift the SITE building with one hand. If you consume Daal on a regular basis, then you too, will reap the muscular gains. </p>

      <h3><u>Steps to cook</u></h3>
      <ol id="recipe-steps"> 
         <li>Wash all the yellow lentils in a big pot by hand. Make sure to rinse them twice. Fill the pot up with 3 cups of water afterwards. </li>
         <li>Cover the pot with a lid, and bring the lentils in the pot to a boil on the stove for 10 minutes, or until the lentils get soft. You can tell if they are soft by repeatedly taste-testing. Try not to burn your tongue!</li>
         <li>While the lentils are cooking, chop the tomatoes. Make sure to remove the tough stem end when cutting. Set aside afterward.</li>
         <li>In another pot, set the heat to medium, and pour in the vegetable oil, cumin seeds, and mustard seeds. Allow the seeds to sit in the oil until there is bubbling around the seeds.</li>
         <li>Put in the onions, but be careful doing so to avoid getting oil burns!</li>
         <li>Saute the onions for 1 minute, and then put in the garlic paste. This will create more flavour within the daal. Stir mixture of onion, paste, and seeds until the onions are golden brown.</li>
         <li>After the onions become golden brown, add in the tomatoes. After that, add another cup water and put in the turmeric and the chilipowder. Stir, then close the pot with a lid and wait for 10 minutes for the tomatoes to get soft.</li>
         <li>After the tomatoes get soft, either use a blender or a big wooden spatula to smash the tomatoes into a liquid. Let the liquid mixture simmer for 5 more minutes.</li>
         <li>Now, put the lentils into the tomato mixture, and mix thoroughly. Wait 5 more minutes for the mixture to simmer, and your daal is ready to give you nutrients for some heavy powerlifting! Oh yeah, and remember to put the cilantro on, since greens are good for you.</li>
