    <h3><u>Steps to cook</u></h3>
      <ol id="recipe-steps"> 
         <li>Put the stove on medium heat. In a skillet, put 1 tablespoon of butter and allow it to melt in the pan. After it's melted, put the cumin seeds, mustard seeds, and onions. </li>
         <li>Stir the mixture for 2 minutes, then add in the ginger garlic paste and salt. Keeping mixing until the onions turn golden brown.</li>
         <li>After the onions are done cooking, turn the heat down to minimum and chop the tomatoes. Make sure to remove the tough stem end when cutting. Move onion mixture into new pot and put tomatoes in pot afterward.</li>
         <li>Put the stove back to medium heat. After the onions in the pot begin to cook again, put in the tomatoes and 1 cup of water in the pot.</li>
         <li>Put in the garam masala, turmeric, chili powder, and coriander powder in the tomato onion mixture. Stir thoroughly, and place the lid on the pot for 10 minutes until the tomatoes get soft. </li>
         <li>After the tomatoes get soft, either use a blender or a big wooden spatula to smash the tomatoes into a liquid. You will get a fine orange-colored paste by doing this. Let the liquid mixture simmer for 5 more minutes.</li>
         <li>Add in the cream and the rest of the butter so that the curry will get some fulfilling thickness along with a more savory taste. </li>
         <li>Now, put the chicken breasts into the curry, and make it so that all the chicken pieces are submerged. Wait 15 more minutes for the chicken to cook thoroughly, and you can taste-test to see if the chicken is cooked.</li>
         <li>After adding some cilantro, I would like to congratulate you on making one of the best dishes known to mankind.</li>
