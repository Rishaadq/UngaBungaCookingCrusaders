            <p id="intro-paragraph">When you are staying up, late at night, don't you want to eat something that is quick to make but also filling your stomach? You don't need to have any fancy ingredients or even do anything fancy while making it!
                Simply grab some garlics, salt and pasta of your choice, and you are done! It is also a classic Italian recipe as well, so no Italians would be mad at how we are cooking pastas.</p>

            <h3>Steps to Cook</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Boil the pasta in a pot with a water that's been salted. Boil it Al Dente (little bit chewy). Typically cooking it 3 or 4 minutes less than the indicated cooking time on the pasta box should be enough.</li>
                <li>While the pasta is boiling, thinly slice the garlics. They don't need to be precise, just cutting them in slices should be enough.</li>
                <li>Drizzle the olive oil to the pan, and slowly roast the garlic slices in low/medium heat. Roast peperoncino (red pepper flakes) in the same pan. When the garlic seems slightly brown, remove from heat. If you roast the garlic for too long, it will taste bitter.</li>
                <li>When the pasta is Al Dente, take it out and put it directly on to the pan with garlic slices. Add a scoop of pasta water and cook the whole thing in medium heat. You can add more cooking water to reach the consistency you would like.</li>
                <li>Keep stirring and mix all ingredients altogether.</li>
                <li>Add parsley to the mixture and mix it all together.</li>
                <li>Move the pasta to the plate. If you want cheesy flavor to the dish, you could try adding grated Parmigiano Regiano cheese, although it wouldn't be considered a traditional Aglio e Olio. (Personally, I found it to go really well with the dish!)</li>
