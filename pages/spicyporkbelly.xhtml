            <h3>Steps to Cook</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Mince or slice the garlics, however you want. Slice the onion and green onions, and slice the pork belly to one bite sizes. (Don't cut it too thick otherwise the seasoning won't go in thoroughly!)</li>
                <li>On to the sauce. Mix all seasonings together except sugar.</li>
                <li>Saute the meat on a round pan on high heat. When the meat starts browning, add sugar to coat the meat with sweetness.</li>
                <li>When meat seems to be ready, add the veggies and sauce together and start stir frying altogether.</li>
                <li>When you think the veggies softened enough and everything has mixed well, it is ready!</li>
            </ol>
